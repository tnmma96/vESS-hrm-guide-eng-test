# Introduction to HRM module

The HRM module consists of all employee data from all departments/divisions in the company. The **Employees** submodule manages and stores all employee records, and provides statistics and analysis from these records. Employee records are centrally managed throughout the employee lifecycle, from onboarding to offboarding. An employee record includes:

- Personal & family information
- Reception, appointment & dismissal decisions
- Pay change decisions
- Labor contracts
- Commendation & discipline decisions
- PIT & insurance records
- Allowances
- Household registration books
- Work history
- Birth certificates
- Medical records
- Degrees & certificates

The **Digital Workplace** submodule allows employees to update their own employee records. Employees can log in to the system and update their own records on the first day of the job, and HR assistants can review and approve changes in these records.

The **Recruitment** submodule is direcly linked with the **Employees** submodule, which allows recruiters to save time by not having to enter the same employee record twice.
